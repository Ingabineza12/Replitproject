        <p id="third">here are some few <em id="places">places</em> to consider while deciding where to visit:</p>

        <h2>National Parks</h2>
         <p id="four"> The national parks of Rwanda are protected ecosystems and wildlife reserves located within
            the borders of Rwanda in east central Africa. In 2020, these protected natural zones include the Volcanoes National Park,
             Akagera National Park and Nyungwe Forest. Maintenance of the national park system, 
             as well as tourism infrastructure and promotion of the parks, 
             is managed by the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) with assistance from government ministries.</p></br></br> <strong> here are some of them:</strong>

          <h5>Akagera national park</h5>
          <h5>Nyungwe national park</h5>
        </div>
        

        <h2>Waterfalls</h2>
        <p id="five"> Whereas most travelers to Rwanda opt for mountain gorillas,
           a hike to the top of any waterfall is an exceptional experience you should not miss out. 
           The land of a thousand hills is blessed with stunning waterfalls, 
           all situated in different locations all over the country. 
           There are no clear words that can describe how stunning it feels but waterfall hiking is the best way to explore the natural wonders which nature has blessed Rwanda with. 
           Waterfall hiking is mostly done as complement of gorilla tours, golden monkey trekking, 
           volcano climbing, nature walks, bird watching and cultural visits which together make a full safari package to the land of a thousand hills.
           ough Rwanda has widely been known for mountain gorillas, the land of a thousand hills offers much more which has not been discovered.
            Despite the joy it feels, waterfall hiking takes perseverance, bravery and energy to reach the top of the falls. 
            The waterfalls are sources of most rivers and streams, which serve as source of water for domestic use and agriculture.
         Waterfalls are well discovered by a nature walk, which is also an added opportunity to see birds and other
          animals such as the Colubus monkeys, red tailed monkeys, black and white colubuses and blue monkeys among others. 
          Interestingly each waterfall has an exceptional history, which make it more memorable. 
          Travelers are reminded to carry their cameras to capture the beautiful snaps for reference and memory. </p></br></br> <strong> here are some of them:</strong>

             It is an outstanding beautiful in land body of water which is enclosed by vertical, 
             green terraced hills along the border of Congo. There are three resort towns namely, Gisenyi,
